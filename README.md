# deprecated-uibuilder-templates

A small collection of templates for [UIBUILDER for Node-RED](https://github.com/TotallyInformation). These used to be included in the UIBUILDER installation but are now outdated and no longer included. They were removed from the UIBUILDER package in version 7.3.0.

Please note that these templates are deprecated and are no longer maintained. They are provided here for reference only.

To use them, you should copy the appropriate folder to the instance root folder of your UIBUILDER node. This is typically located at `~/.node-red/uibuilder/<url>` in your Node-RED installation.

## Templates

* `vue2-bootstrap` - A simple template using Vue 2 and Bootstrap-Vue v2. It demonstrates the various basic features you are likely to want in a simple, dynamic, data-driven user interface that uses the help of the VueJS v2 and bootstrap-vue front-end framework libraries. It includes display of control and standard messages to/from Node-RED as well as a simple form with submission back to Node-RED. Last updated December 2024.
* `vue2-simple` - A much simpler version of the above with minimal code to act as a starting point for your own development. Last updated December 2024.
